###Predictive Model for Video Success
### **Project Description:**
#### The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the number of views a video is likely to receive based on several key attributes. These attributes include:


1. Content :The type or category of the video content, which can be used to analyze different types of content impact.
2. Video Title	:The title of the video, which might influence click-through rates and viewer engagement.
3. Video Publish Time :The date and time the video was published; can be used to identify trends by day, month, or year.
4. Subscribers Gained	:Number of new subscribers gained from this video.
5. Subscribers Lost	:Number of subscribers lost from this video, which can indicate content that may not resonate with viewers.
6. Comments Added	:Number of comments received, indicating viewer engagement and interest in the content.
7. Shares	:Number of times the video was shared, reflecting its potential virality or viewer recommendation.
8. Dislikes	:Number of dislikes the video received, which may indicate negative sentiment.
9. Likes	:Number of likes the video received, a positive engagement metric.
10. Viewed (vs. Swiped Away) (%)	:Percentage of viewers who continued watching versus those who swiped away, showing initial engagement.
11. Shown in Feed	: Indicates whether the video was shown in users' feeds, possibly impacting impressions and visibility.
12. Average Percentage Viewed (%)	:Average percentage of the video watched by viewers, reflecting viewer retention and content engagement.
13. Views	:Total number of views for the video, representing its popularity.(Target Variable)
14. Watch Time (hours)	:Total hours watched for the video, providing insight into overall engagement and content stickiness.
15. Subscribers	:Total subscriber count at the time the video was published.
16. Average View Duration	:Average time a viewer spends watching the video, indicating content relevance or engagement.
17. Impressions	:Number of times the video thumbnail was shown to users, impacting the video's reach.
18. Impressions Click-Through Rate (%)	:Percentage of impressions that led to views, reflecting the effectiveness of the thumbnail and title.
19. Average View Duration (seconds)2	:The average view duration converted to seconds, allowing for easier quantitative analysis.

The dataset used for this project is sourced directly from my YouTube channel, containing real-world data on video performance. By analyzing these factors, the model aims to estimate the potential viewership of a video before it is uploaded or promoted. This can be highly valuable for content creators and marketers, helping them to make data-driven decisions about video content strategy, potential reach, and engagement.
